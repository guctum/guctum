### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Greg, I'm a support engineer with a background in software development working to become a DevOps Engineer. I enjoy working with new technologies, building cloud infrastructure, and learning to deploy projects on the cloud. I currently work as a support engineer for a major technology company, and am enjoying the opportunities to learn as much as possible and refine my skills.
